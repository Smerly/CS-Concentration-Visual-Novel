> ***Nota Bene:*** I just copied this over from the "About" description of our Trello board - collaborators can (and should) edit this over time as needed. Same goes for all the other boilerplate file/folder content I've added, feel free to rearrange things around in your local `clone` or `branch` repos before `push`ing your `commit`s to be `pull`ed/`merge`d back to this `remote-origin` repository on the `main` branch üëçüèΩ
